### 🧠 Overview

I'm a reverse engineer with commercial experience in game security and internal tooling.  
My primary focus is on **undetected private development for Rust**, involving low-level memory manipulation, custom loaders, and anti-reversing techniques.

- 🧱 Developing actively maintained, commercial-grade internal tools for private use
- ⚙️ Specialized in Windows internals, memory scanning, and thread-level manipulation
- 🛡️ Experienced in bypassing modern anti-cheat systems through clean usermode methods
- 🚫 All solutions are built with emphasis on stealth, stability, and long-term viability

### 🛠️ Focus Areas

- **Reverse Engineering**: Static/dynamic analysis, signature removal, behavioral inspection
- **Memory Manipulation**: Pattern scanning, allocation spoofing, dynamic patching
- **Anti-Cheat Evasion**: Syscall spoofing, handle masking, thread cloaking
- **Internal Loaders**: Clean injection methods, context-aware initialization, entropy hardening

### 🧪 Projects

#### 🛡️ [Private Internal – Rust]
Commercial internal Rust project with an undetected track record.  
Features a fully custom usermode loader, secure memory operations, and hardened evasion layers.  
Designed for stability, persistence, and silent operation under active anti-cheat surveillance.

#### 🔐 [Redacted] Lua VM Engine
Custom virtual machine for Lua scripts with encrypted instruction sets and runtime mutation.  
Originally built for server-side use in integrity-sensitive environments such as FiveM.

#### 🎯 recoilgang (auxiliary)
Standalone utility for internal tool configuration and remote data sync.  
Not directly related to any cheat logic; used for controlled parameter management.
